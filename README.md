# Sports Hub
This is a project where the eventual goal is to have a hub of Professional Women's sports scores, stats, standings, schedules, etc. Everyone watches women's sports - now let's get into it! 

## Demo
For a live demo (so you don't have to get your own API key and set it up locally) please see: [https://sports-hub-uzrr.onrender.com/](https://sports-hub-uzrr.onrender.com/). (This might take up to a minute to load depending on when the last render was.)
